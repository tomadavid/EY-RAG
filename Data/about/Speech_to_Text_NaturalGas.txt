In the dynamic world of natural gas extraction, our Client, a leading Oil & Gas company in its country, operates across multiple locations nationwide. However, they faced the pressing issue of unintentional gas flaring, leading to environmental, financial and safety issues.   Each accidental flaring incident not only harms the environment, but also has a significant cost to our Client, creating a need for a proactive solution. To face this sustainability challenge, EY partnered with the Client´s team to find an answer through innovation. By combining Artificial Intelligence with Internet of Things, our team of experts analyzed data from  thousands of sensors distributed across four units. Through careful filtering, the team identified only a few hundred that exhibited significant deviations correlated with past flaring incidents. This data became the foundation for the implementation of EY´s deep learning model. This model uses the selected sensor data to predict potential flaring events, reducing our Client´s footprint in the estimated 144 billion cubic meters of gas burned per year globally. A heuristic was developed to map these predictions to levels of plant instability: Low, Medium, and Critical. Getting real-time monitoring of plant stability was critical, so a breakthrough dashboard was developed to allow teams to do that monitoring. The EY Digital FlareSentinel Dashboard empowers our Client to predict incidents one month in advance. EY's solution reduces environmental impact and achieves significant cost savings, enhancing operational efficiency and… Shaping a sustainable future with confidence.
